# epiphy
Epiphy is a lightweight library for property based data model access.

Epiphytes are pseudo-parasitic plants. They live on the surface of other 
organisms in order to benefit from their environment, but do not break that 
organism's surface, leaving the host unharmed. This prevents the host from 
getting injuries and diseases because the symbiosis, effectively extending 
the epiphyte life's length.
